    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently in the 5th year of my engineering training at the
        <a href="https://www.enib.fr/en/" target="_blank">Brest National School of Engineering (ENIB)</a> and dual
        degree in Master M2 Interactive, Intelligent and Autonomous Systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        I got interested in programming more than 8 years ago and I'm still passionate about it. I now want to turn to
        the field of artificial intelligence, human-machine interactions and virtual environments.
