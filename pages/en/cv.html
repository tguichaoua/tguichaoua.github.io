        <h3>Engineer Assistant Internship</h3>
        <em><a href="https://wwz.ifremer.fr/" target="_blank">Ifremer</a></em>
        <br />
        <em>29 march 2021 - 9 july 2021</em>
        <p>
            As part of my studies at ENIB, I did an engineering assistant internship at the French Institute for
            Research for the Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer).
        </p>
        <p>
            During this internship, I designed a user interface in the form of a PC application to communicate with a
            deep sea temperature sensor.

        <h3>Master M2 &mdash; Interactive, Intelligent and Autonomous Systems</h3>
        <em>2021 - 2022</em>
        <p>
            The IIAS course highlights co-accreditation with the main Brest higher education institutions (UBO, ENIB,
            ENSTA Bretagne and IMT-Atlantique) in order to build a common diploma based on their cutting-edge knowledge
            in the fields of Intelligent and Autonomous Interactive Systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main theme of this course focuses on computer systems linked to humans. More particularly, the notion of
            interactions between artificial systems and humans, whether it is when the human is immersed in a complex
            system, or when he conceives the complexity and creates this system.
        </p>
        <p>
            The course focuses on current knowledge in artificial intelligence, learning, cognitive science, modeling
            and verification, virtual reality, robotics, sensor networks, modeling and simulation using multi-agent
            systems.
