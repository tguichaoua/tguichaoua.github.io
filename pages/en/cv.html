    <h3>Engineer Assistant Internship</h3>
    <em><a href="https://wwz.ifremer.fr/" target="_blank">Ifremer</a></em>
    <br />
    <em>29 march 2021 - 9 july 2021</em>
    <p>
      As part of my studies at ENIB, I did an engineering assistant internship at the French Institute for Research for
      the Exploitation of the Sea (Ifremer).
    </p>
    <p>
      During this internship, I designed a user interface in the form of a PC application to communicate with a deep sea
      temperature sensor.

    <em>31 January 2022 - 29 July 2022</em>

    <p>
      This is my end-of-studies internship as part of my master's degree in Interactive, Intelligent and Autonomous
      Systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The subject was the design of a tracking and communication system for a swarm of robots. The goal being to
      increase their perception to be able to know the position of the neighbors. Ultimately, this project will aim the
      study of behavioral algorithms on the swarm of robots. Prior to this internship, I carried out a study
      bibliography which served me as a state of the art of existing localization methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      The robots used were
      <a href="https://www.hackster.io/university-of-manchester-robotic-lab/mona-robot-ba39d2" target="_blank"
        >Mona robots</a
      >. These robots are often used in the field of research and education because of their low cost and the fact that
      they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software" target="_blank">open-source</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware" target="_blank">open-hardware</a>.

    <p>
      The technical solution adopted is to use the
      <a href="https://www.optitrack.com/" target="_blank">OptiTrack</a> system to obtain the position of the robots,
      then to pass this information to a server coded in Rust which has the role of reworking and redistributing this
      information to the robots.

  <h2>My Training</h2>
  <article>
    <h3><a href="https://www.enib.fr/en/" target="_blank">Brest National School of Engineering</a></h3>
    <em>2017 - 2022</em>
    <p>General engineer training (IT, electronics, mechatronics) with a specialization in IT.</p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <h3>Master M2 &mdash; Interactive, Intelligent and Autonomous Systems</h3>
    <em>2021 - 2022</em>
    <p>
      The IIAS course highlights co-accreditation with the main Brest higher education institutions (UBO, ENIB, ENSTA
      Bretagne and IMT-Atlantique) in order to build a common diploma based on their cutting-edge knowledge in the
      fields of Intelligent and Autonomous Interactive Systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main theme of this course focuses on computer systems linked to humans. More particularly, the notion of
      interactions between artificial systems and humans, whether it is when the human is immersed in a complex system,
      or when he conceives the complexity and creates this system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The course focuses on current knowledge in artificial intelligence, learning, cognitive science, modeling and
      verification, virtual reality, robotics, sensor networks, modeling and simulation using multi-agent systems.
